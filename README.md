# cellular-factor

Cellular automaton visualization written in Factor. Mainly a personal
thing, to get myself more familiar with Factor and concatenative
languages in general.

Entrypoints are in the `cellular` vocabulary.
* `run-in-console` will show an ASCII visualization of the requested
  rule in the terminal.
* `run-in-gui` will open a window and show the given rule using black
  and white cells.
